G = < sigma, N, P, S >
N = { S, A, B }

// `B -> d` and `B -> c A` should be added to the same array, which doesn't happen yet.
// Should we check this in the front during parsing or in the back after parsing???
P = { S -> b A | c | B, A -> a, B -> d } u { B -> c A }

// Similar here, `a` should be added only once.
sigma = { a, b, c } u { ab, bc } u { hola } u { a }
